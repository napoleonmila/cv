        <P>As an experienced IT professional and systems engineer, I am a reliable, hardworking, creative, and highly motivated individual who perseveres to achieve the best results when deploying and managing Linux server infrastructure. Over the last eight years, I have worked in two very productive and empowering environments, including three years as an IT Operations Engineer at Uniregistry and five years as a Senior IT Analyst at Sun West Mortgage.
            My expertise includes providing installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting services for remote data centers and network infrastructure, as well as technical support for customers and company personnel. I have also been responsible for selecting and installing dedicated services such as internet connections, SIP trunks, and collocations for remote locations.
            In particular, I have played a key role in coordinating and executing the migration of PBXs (Cisco PBX "uc560"; Digium the "Switchvox 360"; FreePBX). I have lead the deployment of servers collocation and also coordinated the closure of old collocations, as well as planned the hybrid interconnection of on-premises AD with Azure cloud.
            I have extensive experience in IT support and network infrastructure, having worked on projects that required both technical expertise and strong teamwork. I have been part of a team responsible for managing and troubleshooting the company platform, ensuring that the operations run smoothly meeting our customer’s base needs.</P>
